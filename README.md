# TCStatus:

TCStatus is an iOS app that lets users register public tennis courts near them and check their availability in real time. Once a court is added, users can mark individual courts as “In Use”, allowing others to see which courts are currently occupied. This helps players decide where to go before arriving at a location.

**Features:**

Register public tennis court facilities near your location
Mark courts as In Use or Available
View how many courts at a facility are currently free
Persistent data: courts and their statuses are saved across app launches
Simple, intuitive SwiftUI interface
Expandable framework — adaptable for other types of public spaces
